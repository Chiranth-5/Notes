/*

In C++, the friend class declaration can be placed anywhere inside the classâ€”under the public, private, or protected section. 
It doesn't matter where you put it because friendship is not affected by access specifiers.

In C++, the friend keyword allows a class or function to access private and protected members of another class. 

To provide more flexibility than inheritance when sharing data between classes.
